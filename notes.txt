To have HTTPS url you need a SSL Certificate, you can get the SSL Certificate from any Certification Authorities(CA.

But for local demonstration, we are going to use self signed certificate, generated using keytool available in JDK
Go to the bin directory of your java installation and run the below command:

keytool -genKey -alias demokey -keystore demokeystore -keyalg RSA


I am using the default values, one such field is :
certificate type :- PKCS12.
